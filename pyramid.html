        <h2>Charges</h2>
        The pyramid has 12 charges. A caster may use the pyramid as a spellcasting focus. When a caster casts a damaging spell through the pyramid, the pyramid loses a charge and the spell gains an aditional 1d12 of necrotic damage.
      </div>

      <div class="inflict">
        <h2>Malice</h2>
        Any creature wielding the pyramid may expend; 3 charges from the pyramid as an action to cast Inflict wounds as a second-level spell, 5 charges to cast inflict wounds as a third-level spell, 7 charges to cast inflicht wounds as a fourth-level spell, 9 charges to cast inflict wounds as a fourth level spell, or 11 charges to cast inflict wounds as a fifth-level spell.

        <h2>Soul Rip</h2>
        The drawbacks of the pyramid are similar to those of the heart. The damage die for Soul Rip is increased to 1d12.
        The Con and Wis saving throws become a little harder (DC 16). If a creature has to perform 2 Con or 2 Wis (or more) saving throws in a single long rest, the second of each is done at disadvantage.
        If a creature accrues 8 charges of Soul Rip, if they fail the Wis saving throw, they gain a long term madness instead of a short term.

      <div class="recharge">
        <h2>Ripping Recharge</h2>
      After dealing damage to a single target, the wielder of the pyramid can use a bonus action to attempt to rip part of the soul out of its target. The target takes 2d10 necrotic damage. If this kills the target, the pyramid traps part of the target's soul and regains a charge. The caster suffers the effects as if he cast a spell through the pyramid (1d10 of damage. counts towards madness and soul rip)

      <div class="col-6">
      <div class="empower">
        <h2>Empowered by Hatred</h2>
        When using the pyramid as a focus, the caster may choose to forgo the extra necrotic damage to empower the spell with either "empowered spell" (1 charge) or "heightened spell" (3 charges).
        The caster may use the ripping recharge as a bonus action as if the caster dealt extra necrotic damage. The caster also takes damage equal to the number of charges spent.
      </div>

      <div class="col-6">
      <div class="summon">
        <h2>Empowered by Hatred</h2>
        The caster may expend 8 charges to manifest the negative energies and emotions trapped in the Heart. It has a 25% chance to spawn a "The Hungry" or a "The Lonely" or a "The Lost" or nothing. It appears in a spot within 5 feet of the wielder. The caster must use their bonus action to maintain
        control over the Sorrowsworn. And he must pass a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the sorrowsworn goes berserk, lashing out at anyone
        The caster takes 5d10 and make the Soul Rip con save immediately after summoning the Sorrowsworn

    <p> This is a table I made that shows the attributes of my new magic items. I'm not that great at naming things but these items are made out of a substance called "HemoCrystal". It's a very powerful substance made by Lolth and her priestesses. </p>
