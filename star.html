      <div class="charges">
        <h2>Charges</h2>
        The star has 20 charges. A caster may use the star as a spellcasting focus. When a caster casts a damaging spell through the star, the star loses a charge and the spell gains an aditional 1d20 of necrotic damage.
      </div>

      <div class="col-6">
      <div class="inflict">
        <h2>Malice</h2>
        Any creature wielding the star may expend; 3 charges from the star as an action to cast Inflict wounds as a second-level spell, or they may upcast inflict wounds further by spending 2 charges per spell-level.
      </div>

        <h2>Soul Rip</h2>
        The drawbacks of the star are similar to those of the pyramid. The damage die for Soul Rip is increased to 1d20.
        The Con and Wis saving throws become a little harder (DC 18). If a creature has to perform 2 Con or 2 Wis (or more) saving throws in a single long rest, the second of each is done at disadvantage.
        If a creature accrues 8 charges of Soul Rip, if they fail the Wis saving throw, they gain a long term madness instead of a short term.
          If a creature accrues 8 charges of Soul Rip, if they fail the Wis saving throw, they gain an indefinite madness instead of a long term.

      <div class="recharge">
        <h2>Ripping Recharge</h2>
      After dealing damage to a single target, the wielder of the star can use a bonus action to attempt to rip part of the soul out of its target. The target takes 2d12 necrotic damage. If this kills the target, the star traps part of the target's soul and regains a charge. The caster suffers the effects as if he cast a spell through the star (1d10 of damage. counts towards madness and soul rip)

      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
      <div class="empower">
        <h2>Empowered by Hatred</h2>
        When using the star as a focus, the caster may choose to forgo the extra necrotic damage to empower the spell with either "empowered spell" (1 charge) or "heightened spell" (3 charges).
        The caster may use the ripping recharge as a bonus action as if the caster dealt extra necrotic damage. The caster also takes damage equal to the number of charges spent.
      </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
      <div class="summon">
        <h2>Empowered by Hatred</h2>
        The caster may expend 8 charges to manifest the negative energies and emotions trapped in the Heart. It has a 25% chance to spawn a "The Hungry" or a "The Lonely" or a "The Lost" or nothing. It appears in a spot within 5 feet of the wielder. The caster must use their bonus action to maintain
        control over the Sorrowsworn. And he must pass a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the sorrowsworn goes berserk, lashing out at anyone
        The caster takes 5d10 and make the Soul Rip con save immediately after summoning the Sorrowsworn
      </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-12">
      <div class="capture">
        <h2>Soul Capture</h2>
        The wielder of the star may, as an action, expend 20 points from the star. Doing so allows the caster to cast inflict-wounds as a ninth-spell. The spell deals max damage if it hits.
        If the spell kills the target, the target's  entire soul is immediately trapped inside the star. The star can gain no charges while a soul is trapped in this way. The priestesses of Lolth can perform a ritual to extract the soul to create a HemoCrystal out of the soul. The tier of HemoCrystal depends on the type of soul captured.
        The wielder of the orb must immediately take 10d20 after using this ability. They must also make a DC 20 Con saving throw or gain 3 levels of exhaustion. A non-evil character must also make a DC 20 Wis saving throw or gain a long-term and indefinite-madness.

    <p> This is a table I made that shows the attributes of my new magic items. I'm not that great at naming things but these items are made out of a substance called "HemoCrystal". It's a very powerful substance made by Lolth and her priestesses. </p>
